# What You Are Gonna Get

Stuff that comes in the box for an Hourfleet Network Operator.

When you join Hourfleet, you get your own cloud hosted online car sharing platform, tailored to your business.
You get a tenancy on the Hourfleet platform. Your tenancy can be used to run a car sharing network that supports either P2P car sharing or more conventional B2C car sharing, or both! 

Your tenancy includes the following pieces:

* A customizable, responsive web app that your customers use to find, and use cars.
* Keyless access technology, devices that are fitted into the cars on your network that let borrowers have keyless access to the cars. No keys, smartphone access.
* A customizable, responsive web app that you use to monitor and manage your car sharing network.
* 2nd Tier support by hourfleet support staff.
